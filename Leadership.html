      <h2>KRT (Student Council)</h2>

      <p>I was involved in the student council, KRT(Knights of the Round Table), in my third year of highschool. I joined the student council because I was very interested in arranging and leading school affairs, and also was looking forward to it since I was very little. Overall, I learned a lot during the experience. It was definitely a great opportunity to perform leadership, show initiative and to make Bluevale a better place for both students and staff.</p>

      <p>Me and two of my friends were in the Halls and Walls committee, which is a committee that makes posters, banners, murals and such. Other committees of KRT would send us Google Forms(which I created) of information of the specific event they are going to run, then us three will design and plan the posters and hand it up the date KRT wants us to put up on. Being in this committee was a great challenge. Even though making posters seemed like an easy job at first, I realized that it is not, considering that we had to make a four to five metre-long posters almost every week or every two weeks. It was a lot of workload given to three people.</p>

		<p>Thankfully, we got a significant amount of help from our “Posters & Murals Club”. In the beginning of the year, us the Halls and Walls committee made a club that we will work together in painting the posters. We constantly discussed numerous poster ideas, colour schemes, font, positioning graphics, et cetera. We empowered the club members and mostly let them be as creative as they want, and I focused on the overall runnings of the club.</p>
		<p>Other than Halls & Walls related things, I helped KRT plan and run many events such as Grade 9 Week, Grade 9 Parent-Teacher Night, Orange Shirt Day, Pep Rally Assembly, Knights Unite, Cake Auction, Homeroom Challenges, et cetera. For these events, I had to dedicate most time during school, but also several hours before and/or after school.</p>
		<p>KRT taught me so many valuable lessons. Even though it was not an easy task to be a functional member of the student council, the experience became a solid foundation of my leadership and time management skills. Student Council really brought me to build on my previous experience with leadership.</p>

      <h2>Jr. Leadership</h2>
		<h3>Gateway to Leadership</h3>
      <p>In prior to KRT, I was a part of Jr.Leadership, which is a course that potential KRT students are recommended to take. We learn different types of leadership, and how to apply them based on the circumstances given. One of the major events during Jr. Leadership was Grade 8 Day, which is a day that Grade 8 students from different schools come to visit Bluevale for a tour, along with some exciting outdoor activities. I was one of the Big 3 of the planning committee, the three people who are selected by the class to be the main leaders of the event. Us three were in charge of playing games, planning touring routes, ordering food, setting-up and cleaning-up.</p>
		<p>Overall, Jr. Leadership is one of the most important courses I ever took because it motivated me to become a better leader and how important the role of a leader is in society. Also, it encouraged me to strive forward - and ultimately lead me to join student council the following year!</p>

      <h2>Volunteer Action Team</h2> 
		  <h3>Giving back to the community</h3>
      <p>For 15 weeks, I volunteered at the K-W Volunteer Action Centre as a member of the Volunteer Action Team. We planned several events in the K-W community and debriefed after the events took place about things we did good, and things we can improve on our next event. We also met up with other Volunteer Action Teams to discuss some topics, which was a great opportunity to share creative ideas and thoughts.</p>

      <p>Personally, this was a really great experience for me because I highly value the gesture of giving back to the community, and I was able to do that with such a great team. Volunteering at the VAC taught me how to manage time(since this was a big commitment), and how to interact with members of the community and working together with others as a team.</p>

      <h2>Music Council</h2>
		  <h3>More than just a "leadership opportunity".</h3>
      <p>For three years (gr. 10 ~ 12), I was a member of Music Council. We planned every event that is related to music, such as Winterlude(Christmas concert), Spring Concert, Music Council Retreat, Crossroads(end-of-the-year music camp), K-W Kiwanis Music Festival, and more every year. Meetings took place every Tuesday during lunch, and we mainly planned the events that are stated above. After the events, we had extra meetings to debrief what went well and what we can improve next year, and so on. We are also in charge of the setting up and cleaning up before and after the events take place, and to encourage other students to do so.  In the beginning of every semester, us Music Council take initiative and promote music clubs to the students.</p>

      <p>Music is a big part of me, and to lead the students with the similar interest is a great privilege and opportunity. Being a part of Music Council for three years taught me more than just leadership. It taught me what it feels like to be a part of such a caring and loving team, and the sense of strong responsibility that I will never do anything to disappoint them.</p>
