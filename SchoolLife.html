      <p>As a musically dedicated student of our school, I was involved in two music clubs other than the Music Council. I was involved in both Bluevale Singers(choir) and Concert Band for three years. There were rehearsals for each of the clubs once a week in the mornings and performed the tunes on performances such as the Winterlude(Christmas Concert) or the Spring Concert.</p>
      <p>These two clubs constantly relieved the academic stress I had throughout the semester. Singing/ Playing along with the sheet music, harmonizing, synchronizing with my section boosted my energy. Sometimes, I got lazy and wanted to skip the rehearsals, but since I knew that I will feel so much more awake and ready for the day, I got up early in the mornings and attended every single rehearsal.</p>
	  <p>I learned how to manage time, a sense of responsibility (I was the only person playing Bells), and how to commit and dedicate to do something. Overall, I think it is my privilege to be in such various music clubs that bring the best of me!</p>
	  <h3>Peer Tutoring</h3>
	  <p>As I became a senior, I wanted to try something new - then I discovered Peer Tutoring. I was always aware that there was a peer tutor but never thought of being one. One day, I decided to step up and try it. I encouraged myself and also a couple of my friends to do it with me. There was one session per week which lasted about an hour. Students came in and asked us for help with their homework/assignments/projects. Peer tutoring really helped me improve my teaching skills because that used to be my big issue. I always had a thought in mind that I won’t be a good teacher as him/her and compare me to others. However, the title “peer” tutor encouraged me to think that it is okay not to be good at teaching because we are “peers”. I am grateful for this experience and hope to continue this experience as a peer tutor next semester.</p>

      <h2>Pre-AP & AP courses</h2>
		<h3>Chance to explore more of my interests</h3>
      	<p>Other than Pre-AP Math, I was also involved in Pre-AP Science in grade 10, Pre-AP English in both grades 10 and 11, and (will be involved in) AP English. I was always eager to learn beyond the curriculum given and wanted to pursue what I was passionate about. Pre-AP courses I took was a chance for me to investigate the properties of subjects that interested me. Even though the Science field came out to be one of my least favorite subjects, I discovered that I very much enjoy literature and Shakespeare!</p>
