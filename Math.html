      <h2>Math Circles at UW</h2>
		<h3>Not like high school math...but better!</h3>
      <p>Every Wednesday for 24 weeks of my high school career, I was involved in Math Circles, one of the Face-to-Face workshops the University of Waterloo and CEMC(Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing) provides for students of various grades.</p>

      <p>I started Math Circles in the first semester in grade 11. I had a huge interest in mathematics, and I was so eager to learn beyond the high school curriculum. Then I discovered this great opportunity to experience the deeper aspects of math.</p>
	  <p>Without a doubt, it was the best choice I have ever made.</p>
	  <p>There were thrill and excitement that I haven’t experienced before, and I became more certain as Math Circles progressed throughout the years. The materials were challenging. However, that was the charm. Discussing different ideas to approach the question with fellow students was something I have never come across in school. I was able to broaden and extend my experience in undiscovered areas or Mathematics.</p>
	  <p>The more Math Circles became enjoyable, the more I resented my past self for not joining it earlier. It was such a blissful and fruitful experience that I would like to recommend this opportunity for students of all grades; both who enjoy and do not enjoy math.</p>

      <h2>Mathletics</h2>
		<h3>"Live Free or PI Hard. Be there or b<sup>2</sup>!"</h3>
      	<p>At the beginning of grade 11, two of my friends made a club called, “Mathletics”. We solve math problems and play math-related games together and the one who gets the correct answer or the highest points wins treats and/or prizes. There were meetings every Friday, except for PA days or holidays. We took turns to prepare for each meeting and gave everyone a chance to lead a group. Since our club members were so comfortable with each other, the leadership initiative was so natural and casual, it brought out the best of every one of us. I also participated in planning several meetings over the two years, and the club was very supportive and showed incredible participation!</p>

	  	<p>Joining and co-running Mathletics was a great opportunity for me to boost my confidence, and also to step up and show initiative. Thanks to my fellow club members, I can now fully lead a game! :) </p>

      <h2>Math Contests & Math Workshops</h2>
      <h3>Math Contests</h3>
      <p>For the past 4 years of high school, I participated in almost every math contest I can write. It was more like testing myself for how mathematically creative I can be, and how much of an out-of-the-box thinker I am. I focused more on the growth of my math skills, other than what mark I end up getting. One time, I wanted to write the Cayley Math Contest so bad, I went to school only for the contest two days after I got my appendicitis surgery. Thinking back, it was a crazy thing to do, but even though I go back, I would do the same thing over again.</p> 
	  <p>List of the contests I wrote: <br><br>
		  <i>2016 Gauss</i><br>
		  <i>2016 CIMC</i><br>
		  <i>2017 Pascal</i><br>
		  <i>2017 Fryer</i><br>
		  <i>2017 Beaver Computing Challenge</i><br>
		  <i>2017 CIMC(scored 48)</i><br>
		  <i>2018 Cayley</i><br>
		  <i>2018 CSMC(scored 43)</i><br>
		  <i>2019 CSMC</i><br>
		  <i>(will write in the future)2020 Canadian Computing Challenge</i><br>

	  <h3>Think about Math! Workshop</h3>
	  <p>In grade 10, I participated in the “Think about Math!” workshop. The workshop was for girls in grade 9 or 10 who had an interest in math and to ignite their interest in math in high school. Several University of Waterloo faculty members came in for the day and taught us about the lifestyles and career paths of women who have graduated from the faculty of mathematics. We also solved several math problems as a team and participated in several hands-on activities.</p>

	  <p>It was a great opportunity to gather around with people of similar interests, and discuss math. Overall, it was one of the greatest opportunities that ignited my interest in mathematics. I learned a lot about the career paths of students who graduate with a math degree, and how each career can affect society.</p>

      <h2>3 Years of Pre-AP Math</h2>
		<h3>Best of the Best courses!</h3>
      <p>I was in the Pre-AP curriculum for Math for three years.</p>
      <p>Personally, it was amazing. The class all had some interest in math, which kept the class participated and focused all semester long, and we also had one of the best teachers of the Mathematics faculty. I cannot think of one bad thing that happened to me in those classes. The atmosphere of the classes, in general, was so welcoming and pleasant… It was just perfect! Unfortunately, even though I so wanted to take Grade 12 AP Advanced Functions, not enough students applied for it, so I was not able to participate in the AP course. However, I am still doing great in my current class, and I hope the class will bring the best of me!</p>

      <h2>Problem of the Week & Month</h2>
		<h3>Very challenging, but more than worth it!</h3>
      <p>Starting from September of 2019, I solved the Problem of the Week every week and the Problem of the Month every month. The questions were sometimes very challenging (eg. Problem of the Month), but I managed to fight through and solve it. And even though some questions seemed impossible to solve, I looked up the solutions the next week/month and understand the concept that I missed thoroughly. Images of my solutions are attached below.</p>
