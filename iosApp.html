      <h2>About CoSpend</h2>
      <h3>A Guide to the Application</h3>
   	  <p>CoSpend is an iOS application I created that can be used among people living with roommates to reduce conflicts.<br>Below is the icon in the home screen and the launching screen.</p>

		<p>In the Home tab, there is a text field for the users to enter the address of their shared house, in case they forget them. Below that, there are the universal house rules of roommates.</p>

			</div>
		<p>The next tab is Groceries. Roommates can add items they want to the list. If the user clicks the “+” button on the top left, a pop-up window appears. The user can then enter the item they are willing to add. If the user enters text, the size of the Cancel button will decrease and the Done button will appear. If the user presses Cancel, the text written will not be added to the Groceries list, but if the user presses the Done button, the text written will be added to the list.</p>

		<p>The final tab is Bills. This page contains four toggle switches - Rent, Hydro, Water and Internet. Next to each switch, there is a label that states, “Paid?”. If the user has paid for the item, the user can toggle the switch to on(green). If not, the user can toggle the switch to off(white). All switches are set to on in default.</p>

	  <h2>The Journey</h2>
		
	  <p>This was my very first time creating an app. In the past, I used the think that making an app could be an interesting experience, but not what I can do. However, after watching several YouTube videos that are related to this topic, I went, “Why not? I’m gonna give it a try.”</p>
	  <p>In order to make an app, I needed some guidelines that I can follow through because this was my very first time developing an application. I watched many online tutorials to get used to the program that I had to use, XCode, and the language, Swift.</p>
		<img src="../media/app/tutorials-01.png" alt="tutorials" class="responsive">
			<p>Then, I brainstormed some ideas that came into my mind. Here are some crazy thoughts I had: Tip Calculator, Christmas List, VR Theater Seats, and many more! I decided to do something realistic and practical, which was this app, CoSpend. However, I am willing to make more of these apps in the future when I learn more about iOS app development.</p>

      <h2>What did I take away from this experience?</h2>
		<h3>Difficulties & How I overcame them</h3>
      <p>Learning a new programming language is equivalent to learning a new language. I was used to basic programming languages such as Python or Java, which I learned and practiced at school. Getting used to the language was one of the most challenging tasks to complete. I watched almost every online tutorials that were available and took my time and dedication to break into the language and software. Even though I am still not used to many functions of the language, I can now manipulate the code diligently and efficiently.</p>
		<h3>Overall,</h3>
		<p>I learned that developing an app is not an easy task. There were so many obstacles that stopped me from executing the code, and my shortage of knowledge also slowed down the development. However, I learn so much about fighting my way through while building this app. I learned that giving up is not an option - I either do it or not. If I start something, I should stay strong and try my best to achieve my goal. This principle helped me a lot during the semester when I was stressed out about my academics. I worried and got anxious every time I got a bad mark back from my tests. But, I realized that if I try my very best, the outcomes will show proof.</p>
		<p>Even though I hesitated to start making an app or not, however, I am very glad and proud of myself for doing so. Yes, obstacles became bigger obstacles, and those sometimes tore me apart, but it was still a satisfying experience that taught me many lessons.</p>
